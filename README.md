# README

So this is going to be my very first rails project.  I am creating a site for a [Temecula Kitchen Remodeling](https://www.caronconstruction.com) contractor and I’m looking forward to exploring the possibilities of Ruby on Rails.

My experience with rails is very limited.  I usually just create my sites in Wordpress, but I wanted to test the ranking ability of Ruby on Rails.  

This is going to be my first site for a contractor, so I really want to be able to make something special for them.  They also do [bathroom remodeling](https://www.caronconstruction.com) as well as other services.  Their main focus, however, is Kitchens and Bathrooms.

While the SEO is taking effect, I am going to run some adwords for them.  Hopefully it won’t be too hard to narrow down the keywords.
